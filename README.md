# Ships
Ships is an iOS arcade game built around simple touch controls and escalating tension. The player steers a constantly moving ship by tapping the left or right sides of the screen to tilt and change direction. It is an adaptation of the game [15 Coins by Engaging Games LLC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2o16iPU9-j0).

## At a Glance  
As you navigate the space, ghost ships periodically spawn and pursue the exact path you’ve already traveled—turning your past movement into a growing threat. The challenge is to survive as long as possible while collecting spawning coins and avoiding the ever-increasing swarm of ghost ships.
